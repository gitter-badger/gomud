# gomud
Gomud is a base project for a mud/roguelike I've been working on and off forever. 

# features
- golang backend
- websocket connection
- ansi control sequences
- html5 canvas

# thanks
I based the textmode rendering on code from evilpaul.org (with permission), I added ANSI control sequences
on top of that to make a delightfully fast and accurate ANSI rendering on html5 canvas.

# is it any good?
Certainly pretty... but time will tell.
